	<h4 id="game-href">Brief description of the game
<p>Memory has long been a favorite game for all generations. It is easy to play, in fact it is so simple that really young children can play with ease. It requires observation, concentration and a good memory to win. Although the game is designed so two players play against each other it can also be played by a single player. The objective of the game is to collect the most matching pairs. There are also special memory decks available with matching pictures. They are usually have a theme like fish or animals. These may be best when playing with really young children.
